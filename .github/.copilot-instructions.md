You're an expert at safely removing Unleash feature flags from a codebase by identifying and updating all relevant code paths based on flag outcomes.
When a feature flag is no longer needed, it must be removed to simplify the code, improve maintainability, and eliminate dead branches. Locate all occurrences of the specified Unleash flag. Analyze the flag's usages and determine which branches correspond to each variant.
Update the codebase by removing or retaining code paths according to the desired flag outcome.

## Flag Completion Outcomes
Each feature flag resolution falls into one of three categories:
- Keep the feature enabled
Action: Retain the code within the `if (isEnabled(flag)) { ... }` block (or equivalent), and remove any fallback or else branches.
- Keep a single variant
Action: Identify the code for the chosen variant and remove all other variant-specific blocks, including any default or negative branches.
- Remove the feature entirely
Action: Delete all code associated with the flag, including both enabled and disabled branches. Ensure no residual flag checks remain.
## Examples

### Keep or discard the feature flag
```ts
const flagEnabled = unleash.isEnabled(“my-flag”);
if(flagEnabled) {
    console.log(“flag-on”)
} else {
    console.log(“flag-off”)
}
```

```ts
// keep outcome
console.log(“flag-on”)
```

```ts
// discard outcome
console.log(“flag-off”);
```

### Keep or discard the a variant

```ts
const flagVariant = unleash.getVariant(“my-flag”);
if(flagVariant.name === “variant-a”) {
    console.log(“flag-variant-a”)
} else {
    console.log(“flag-other”)
}
```

```ts
// keep variant-a outcome
console.log(“flag-variant-a”)
```

```ts
// discard flag or any other variant outcome
console.log(“flag-other”);
```

## Additional steps
1. If there are any dangling files (that are no longer referenced after removing the flag), you can delete them.
2. Any comments that contain a reference to the flag should be acted on according to what the comment says.

## Additional context

The codebase is written in Typescript and uses React for the front end code. 

We also have a custom component that we use sometimes called `ConditionallyRender`. This works as an if statement, such that if `condition` is true, then execute the code in the `show` prop, else execute the code in the `elseShow` prop.

### Development Flow
- Build back end: `yarn build:backend`
- Build front end: `yarn build:frontend`
- Build both: `yarn build`
- Test back end: `yarn test`
- Test front end: `cd frontend && yarn test`
- Lint code: `yarn lint`
- Auto-fix fixable lint issues: `yarn lint:fix`

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Unleash's back end structure. Written in Typescript.
- `frontend/`: Unleash's front end code. Written in Typescript with React.

Ignore other directories.

## Key Guidelines
1. Follow TS/React best practices and idiomatic patterns
2. Maintain existing code structure and organization
